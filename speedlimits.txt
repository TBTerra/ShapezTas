placing single items(1frame)
	move,frame,click (might even have some sub frame shinanagans)
	if you wish to swap items or change rotation do so after move, before frame
placing line with corners(2+2*corners frames)
	move,frame,down,move1,frame,frame,move2,frame,frame,move3,frame,up
	maybe only one frame per corner, but then they can get a little odd (not 100% reliable)
placing line
	move,frame,down,move1,frame,up(2frames)
note: drags seem to be much more touchy with frame timings, leave extra few ms spare
Select and delete (3 frames)
	move,frame,ctrlD,down,move,frame,up,ctrlU,del,frame
camera moves:(5 frames)
	move,frame,down,move1,4frames,up


note: any extractor placed within the first 2.5sec of the game starting will all output at the same time
this means that as long as its put down in that time, it will act like it was placed tick1
